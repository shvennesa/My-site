      <h2> Hello. </h2>
      <p class="bio"> I am passionate about my work since I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use programming language such as HTML, CSS and more to create my own website. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs. </p>

          <h3> Leadership </h3>
          <p> I have an open, enthusiastic style of leadership. To me, a leader wants to nurture others to their fullest potential, and it is something I have enjoyed doing most of my life. I love to be an example for others to follow and help guide people to bettering themselves and improving their career trajectory. I've found that my teammates aren't afraid to bring me their questions or most significant challenges since they know we will collaborate to figure it out and learn from the situation together.</p>
